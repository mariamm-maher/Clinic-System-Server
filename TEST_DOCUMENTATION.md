## 🎯 Best Practices Followed

1. **Isolation**: Each test runs independently
2. **Descriptive Names**: Test names clearly describe what's being tested
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each test focuses on one specific behavior
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Both happy path and error scenarios
5. **Mock Usage**: External dependencies are properly mocked
6. **Data Cleanup**: Tests clean up after themselves
7. **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests use realistic data and workflows

This comprehensive test suite ensures the clinic management system is reliable, secure, and maintainable. Each test serves a specific purpose in validating the system's functionality and can help identify issues before they reach production.
